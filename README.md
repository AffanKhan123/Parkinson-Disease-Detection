# Parkinson-Disease-Detection
ML project detecting Parkinson's disease using voice features. Explores data, builds classifiers, achieves 91% accuracy after tuning. Focuses on early disease detection.
# Steps
1. Hypothesis - Null, Shapiro-wilk Test, Predictive-LinearRegression
2. EDA
3. Data Preprocessing
4. Visualization - Univariate analysis and Bivariate analysis
5. Feature Selection
6. Building the classifers and choosing the best.
7. Hyperparameter Tuning

# Conclusion
In this project, leveraging XGBoost and voice feature analysis, we aimed to detect Parkinson's disease. Through rigorous data exploration, model building, and hyperparameter tuning, our XGBoost model achieved a commendable 91% accuracy, underscoring its potential for early disease detection. This project underscores the significance of utilizing voice-based attributes in the development of effective tools for Parkinson's disease identification.
